    /* Challenge Goal
     *  In this challenge, you are implementing part of a break-out style game.
     * If you are not familiar with this type of game, check out this wiki page (and a youtube video)...
     *  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)
     *  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW7Sg5pXAok 
     * 
     * The game is partially/mostly implemented for you. You are not writing the game's simulation code.
     *  What you are writing is the graphics (i.e. the display). Everything else is already completed. 
     *  The display should be implemented with ASCII style graphics, print/println...the things you are familiar with. 
     *  You get to pick the display details (like what character is used for the walls, ball, etc). 
     *  Just make it look good, make it your own.
     * 
     * The game has side/top walls, a ball, a paddle at the bottom (controlled with the mouse), and bricks.
     * 
     **********************************************************************************************
     *** THIS IS THE ONLY FILE YOU SHOULD MODIFY FOR THE MAIN/DISPLAY PORTION OF THIS CHALLENGE ***
     **********************************************************************************************
     *  
     * But...if manage to complete this, an additional challenge is to modify the game in some way.
     *  One possibility is to add support for a 'multi-ball' powerup. For this additional challenge, 
     * you can (and should) modify the other files. Be creative, make it fun.

        /* TODO
         * Replace this with your code. You can create your own methods in this class, but do not modify
         *  the other files for the main part of this challenge (note that if/when you get to the additional 
         *  challenge portion, then you can/should modify the other files).
         * 
         * Tips...
         *  - You should probably start by drawing the walls & ceiling.
         *  - Call 'sim.endFrame()' after drawing the scene. This will update the simulation, then pause & clear the terminal.
         *  - You should keep looping until the game is complete (check out Simulations's public methods to check for done).
         *  - Look at the comments at the top of Simulation for more details about the game world & how to use it.
